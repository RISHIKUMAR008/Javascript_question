Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2
in js




function missingNumber(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Sum of first n natural numbers
    const actualSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // Sum of elements in the array
    return expectedSum - actualSum; // The difference is the missing number
}
