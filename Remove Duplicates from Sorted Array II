Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).





function removeDuplicates(nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 2) return nums.length; // If there are 2 or fewer elements, no duplicates need to be removed

    let k = 2; // Start from index 2, since the first two elements can stay as they are

    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // If the current element is not the same as the element at k - 2,
        // it means we can keep this element because it would not exceed two duplicates.
        if (nums[i] !== nums[k - 2]) {
            nums[k] = nums[i];
            k++;
        }
    }

    return k;
}
