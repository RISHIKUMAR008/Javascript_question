Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3



function majorityElement(nums) {
    let candidate = nums[0];
    let count = 0;

    // Step 1: Find the candidate
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }
        count += (num === candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }

    // Step 2: Since it's guaranteed that a majority element exists,
    // `candidate` will be the majority element
    return candidate;
}
