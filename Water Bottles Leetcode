There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.


Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.










function numWaterBottles(numBottles, numExchange) {
    let totalDrank = numBottles;
    let emptyBottles = numBottles;

    while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
        let newBottles = Math.floor(emptyBottles / numExchange);
        totalDrank += newBottles;
        emptyBottles = newBottles + (emptyBottles % numExchange);
    }

    return totalDrank;
}

// Example usage
console.log(numWaterBottles(9, 3));  // Output: 13
console.log(numWaterBottles(15, 4)); // Output: 19
