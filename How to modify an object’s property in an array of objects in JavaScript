How to modify an objectâ€™s property in an array of objects in JavaScript 


let employees_data = [
    {
        employee_id: 1,
        employee_name: "Aman",
    },
    {
        employee_id: 2,
        employee_name: "Bhargava",
    },
    {
        employee_id: 3,
        employee_name: "Chaitanya",
    },
];

const modifiedEmployees = employees_data.map(obj => {
    if (obj.employee_id === 2) {
        return { ...obj, employee_name: "rahul" };
    }
    return obj;
});

console.log(modifiedEmployees);





Output


[
  { employee_id: 1, employee_name: 'Aman' },
  { employee_id: 2, employee_name: 'rahul' },
  { employee_id: 3, employee_name: 'Chaitanya' }
